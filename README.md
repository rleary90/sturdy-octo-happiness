## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Supervised Learning: Predicting Autism Diagnosis](https://github.com/rleary90/sturdy-octo-happiness/blob/master/Supervised%20Learning/Capstone%20Supervised%20Learning%20Final.ipynb): A model to predict whether or not a child will be diagnosed with ASD based on parent responses using various statistical tools. Identified which parent responses best predict an ASD diagnosis.
