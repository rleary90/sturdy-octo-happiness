Now is your chance to show your understanding of the data science workflow.

For this stage, we want you to build out a notebook that builds and demonstrates your data science product. Reference other scripts as needed, but be sure to include those in the same repo. This notebook should demonstrate your technical prowess as well as visualization and narrative storytelling. As such it should include all stages of your process in a clean, easy to read form.

Specifically make sure to:

Wrangle your data. Get it into the notebook in the best form possible for your analysis and model building.
Explore your data. Make visualizations and conduct statistical analyses to explain what’s happening with your data, why it’s interesting, and what features you intend to take advantage of for your modeling.
Build a modeling pipeline. Your model should be built in a coherent pipeline of linked stages that is efficient and easy to implement.
Evaluate your models. You should have built multiple models, which you should thoroughly evaluate and compare via a robust analysis of residuals and failures.
Present and thoroughly explain your product. Describe your model in detail: why you chose it, why it works, what problem it solves, how it will run in a production like environment. What would you need to do to maintain it going forward?
